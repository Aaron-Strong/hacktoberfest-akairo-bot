# Hacktoberfest Akairo Bot

A Discord bot using the [discord-akairo](https://github.com/discord-akairo/discord-akairo) framework to help beginners get started in Hacktoberfest!


## What is Hacktoberfest?  
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with DEV — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors toward issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. Sign up to participate today at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. 


## How to Contribute

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) the repository!
2. Create a new file in the `commands` folder.
3. Place the file in a folder for the appropriate command category.
    - For example, a command that adds two numbers would go into `./commands/math/`.
    - If the folder does not exist, create it.
4. Create a pull request with your changes!
